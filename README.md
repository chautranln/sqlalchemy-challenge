# SQLAlchemy_challenge
For this assignment, I connected with other students in the class for support to troubleshoot my code. I also used chatgbt for errors with my syntax and suggestions on how to improve my code. Whenever I was stuck, I also looked at other people's coding (i.e stackoverflow, etc.) to compare to mine.
